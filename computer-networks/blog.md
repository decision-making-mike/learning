## Update 14

This update introduces two changes to the blog. One, a different pattern for naming updates. Two, the movement of TODOs from the blog to separate files in the repository of the blog. For now only one file contains anything, namely [ongoing-reads.txt](ongoing-reads.txt). Both changes are mirrored from my other project, [sql-and-postgresql-learning](https://github.com/decision-making-mike/sql-postgresql-learning). There, in the README, you can read more about the motivation for them.

As you might notice, in update 2024-12-10 I have added a section "Current learning goals summary" at the top of the blog. Today I have replaced the term "goal" with the term "TODO", and have simplified the title. Now the section is consistent with that same section in my other GitHub blog about learning SQL and PostgreSQL. I'm going to update the blog together with this section as I will be completing existing and adding new TODOs.

As for completing TODOs, today I have read TODO 1 up to page 103.

I have read up to page 95.

Let me talk a bit about my reading speed. So far, my average reading speed equals

```math
\frac{(95 - 1)\,\text{pages}}{(\text{2024-12-10} - \text{2024-11-24} + 1)\,\text{days}} = \frac{94\,\text{pages}}{17\,\text{days}} \approx 5.5\,\frac{\text{pages}}{\text{day}}.
```

The book has 816 pages, that is, according to the publisher and my counting. I'm not going to read the parts containing the index and sources, so excluding their pages there is 768 pages left. Excluding the read 94 pages, I'm left with 674 pages. If I continue reading at this speed, I will read the whole book in

```math
\frac{674\,\text{pages}}{5.5\,\frac{\text{pages}}{\text{day}}} \approx 123\,\text{days} \approx 4\,\text{months}.
```

So, I will complete the book in the first half of April 2025. Acceptable.

Now, the maximum average reading speed I feel I can currently aim for is about

```math
8.5\,\frac{\text{pages}}{\text{day}}.
```

This speed will let me to complete those 674 pages in

```math
\frac{674\,\text{pages}}{8.5\,\frac{\text{pages}}{\text{day}}} \approx 79\,\text{days}.
```

If we compare it to the average speed calculated above, this is better by

```math
\frac{123\,\text{days} - 79\,\text{days}}{123\,\text{days}} \cdot 100\,\% \approx 36\,\%.
```

We'll see how I'll be doing.

Today I started the blog. Also, I started reading a book "Sieci komputerowe. Ujęcie całościowe", by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross. See https://helion.pl/ksiazki/sieci-komputerowe-ujecie-calosciowe-wydanie-vii-james-kurose-keith-ross,sieu6v.htm#format/d. I have read up to page 25, thereby completing the parts "O autorach" and "Przedmowa".
